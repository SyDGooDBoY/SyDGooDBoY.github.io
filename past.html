        <h4 class="PastContentsH">HSC</h4>
        <p class="PastContentsP">High school life is between stressful and relaxing, I didn’t get too much homework
            after class and I had a part-time job in a restaurant. I only get nervous when exams come. Even though I
            passed all the exams in high school, my ATAR is terrible. I screwed up the math and physics exam so the ATAR
            is only about 65. After I graduated from high school, I went to diploma to try to get another way to get
            into UTS and I did it.</p>
        <h4 class="PastContentsH">Photography</h4>
        <p class="PastContentsP">When I was 18, I got my first DSLR camera from my uncle, I started my photography life.
            I went to a lot of places inside and outside of Sydney to take photos and post them on my Instagram. Taking
            and editing photos can make me feel free and relaxed.</p>
        <h4 class="PastContentsH">IT experiences</h4>
        <p class="PastContentsP">Before I graduated from high school, I didn’t learn any computer knowledge in school.
            At that time, all my IT knowledge is from the internet, I like IT stuff, and I want to develop some cool
            things in the future, so I decided to study IT in diploma and university.
